# Gate_Driver_Controller
Its an FPGA-based gate driver controller. It produces up to three pairs of PWMs by using three reference signals. The dead-time is runtime adjustable through a potentiometer which is sampled by the sigma-delta ADC written into the FPGA logic. It also produces a pair of center-aligned PWMs, suitable to drive a full-bridge converter.
